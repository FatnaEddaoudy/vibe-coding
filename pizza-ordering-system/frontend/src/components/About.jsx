            <p>
              Since 1975, Tony's Pizza has been serving authentic Italian pizza made with the finest ingredients. 
              Our traditional wood-fired ovens and family recipes create the perfect combination of crispy crust 
              and melted cheese that keeps customers coming back for more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every pizza is hand-tossed and made to order, ensuring the freshest and most delicious experience 
              with every bite. We source our ingredients locally and use only the best Italian cheeses and 
              authentic San Marzano tomatoes.
