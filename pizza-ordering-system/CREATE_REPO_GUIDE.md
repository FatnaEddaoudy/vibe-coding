# 🚀 GitHub Repository Creation Guide

## The Issue
The repository doesn't exist yet on GitHub. Here are the steps to create it:

## Option 1: Create in vibe-coding Organization (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Repository
1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/organizations/vibe-coding/repositories/new
2. **Or go to**: https://github.com/vibe-coding → "Repositories" → "New"

### Step 2: Repository Settings
- **Repository name**: `pizza-ordering-system`
- **Description**: `Complete full-stack pizza ordering system with React frontend and C# ASP.NET Core backend`
- **Visibility**: Public ✅
- **Initialize repository**: 
  - ❌ **DO NOT** add README file (we have one)
  - ❌ **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we have one)  
  - ❌ **DO NOT** choose a license (we can add later)

### Step 3: Create Repository
- Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 4: Push Code
After creating the repository, run:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/vibe-coding/pizza-ordering-system.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Option 2: Create in Personal Account First

If you don't have access to create in vibe-coding org:

### Step 1: Create in Personal Account
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `pizza-ordering-system`
3. **Create repository** (same settings as above)

### Step 2: Push to Personal Account
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/eddaoudyfatima/pizza-ordering-system.git
git push -u origin master
```

### Step 3: Transfer to Organization
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Transfer ownership"
4. Transfer to `vibe-coding` organization

## Option 3: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
# Create in organization
gh repo create vibe-coding/pizza-ordering-system --public --description "Complete full-stack pizza ordering system"

# Or create in personal account
gh repo create pizza-ordering-system --public --description "Complete full-stack pizza ordering system"
```
